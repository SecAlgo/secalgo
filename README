#SecAlgo

This directory currently contains some preliminary work for a project whose
goal is the creation of of higher-level abstractions for encryption and other
security functions in order to help address the problem of security tool
misuse among developers of secure software.

New work is currently being done on the "new_protocols" branch. Please switch to that
branch to see recent changes. It will be merged into the master branch soon.
